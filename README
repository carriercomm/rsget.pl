TODO:
- Write documentation


Features:
- Perfect for screen session
- Support for many download services
- Supports multiple network interfaces
- Dead interfaces are kicked out (useful with unreliable vpn tunnels)
- Continues partially downloaded files (if download service allows it)
- Incorporates small HTTP server allowing to check the status of downloads,
  and add new links.

Bugs:
- MicroHTTP freezes whole program if there is an open connection.


Command-line options:
 -p <PORT>      - starts MicroHTTP server at specified port
 -i <IF1>,<IF2> - list of network interfaces or IP numbers
 <FILENAME>     - file to use as link list file (must exist)
